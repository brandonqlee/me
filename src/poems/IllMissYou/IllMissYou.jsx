                        Laughter echoes down the tunnel slide as the swings creak<span style={{color: "black"}}>mirror</span><br/>
                        thirsting for oil. I scout the area for potential foes as a blanket<br/>
                        of clouds pass to reveal a wash of blue ripening to a dark orange.<br/>

                        The lights overhead dim as the music approaches with a bouquet<br/>
                        of colors shooting around the walls. Their cheer masks my missed notes while<br/>
                        reality dissolves into sand that escapes between my fingers.<span style={{color: "black"}}>get.</span><br/>

                        A downpour of memories showers on my head as<br/>
                        a flood of doubt and fear slowly rise above my<br/>
                        ankles. Why can’t I live like the normal others?<br/>
                        <br/>
                        I’ll miss you<br/>
                        <br/>
                        My plane didn’t travel across lands but through<span style={{color: "black"}}>you</span><br/>
                        time. The destination ahead is another timeline, another<br/>
                        me I have to wear. Another unknown I have to endure.<br/>
